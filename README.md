# Data Compression Algorithms Overview

## Project Summary
This project presents the implementation and application of the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm in Python. The algorithm is utilized to compute the capacity of discrete memoryless channels (DMCs). By analyzing channel transition probability distributions, the algorithm determines the maximum mutual information between the input and output of the channels.

## Contents
The project comprises two main sections:

### Implementation

### Applications
The algorithm is applied to various channels, and their capacities are computed:

- Channel A
- Channel B
- Channel C
- Channel D
- Channel E

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to showcase the effectiveness of the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm in computing channel capacities. By implementing and applying the algorithm to different channel models, the project provides insights into information theory and channel capacity analysis, demonstrating its practical relevance in communication systems and information processing tasks.
